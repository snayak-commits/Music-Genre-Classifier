## Music Genre Classification Using Machine Learning

### Introduction

This project involves building a music genre classifier using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify audio tracks into different genres such as Classical, Metal, Pop, Hip-Hop, and Rock. The project leverages multiple machine learning classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, CatBoost, and XGBoost, along with simple neural networks. The performance and accuracy of these models are evaluated and visualized through various graphs.

### Objectives

- **Classify music tracks** into genres using machine learning algorithms.
- **Compare performance** of different classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, and Simple Neural Networks.
- **Visualize data** and model results, including genre-specific graphs, heatmaps of MEAN values, and accuracy/error graphs for training and testing datasets.

### Data
